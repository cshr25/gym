1. Create micro grid learning environment
2. Introduce random variables as wweather, load consumption and disturbance
3. Decide learning method 
4. Decide learning space: time, SoC status, communication traffic(?)
5. Learning method tuning: learning rate, convergence, adaptive capability to changing envirenment
6. Online learning in real application
7. Test result with overall information shared by bus line and local SoCs.
